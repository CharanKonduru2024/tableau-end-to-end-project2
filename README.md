# HR Analytics Dashboard (Tableau + SQL)

**Live dashboard:**  
[HR ANALYTICS DASHBOARD on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_17586066927610/HRANALYTICSDASHBOARD?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## What this project does
- End-to-end HR analytics from raw CSVs → cleaned tables → interactive dashboard.
- SQL transformations for **attrition rate, tenure, job satisfaction**, and **segment KPIs**.
- Filters for **department, job role, age band, education, gender**; drill-downs for trends.

## Key questions answered
- Where is **attrition** highest (dept/role/age/education)?
- Which groups have **low satisfaction** and **high exit risk**?
- How do **tenure** and **salary bands** (if available) correlate with attrition?

## Core metrics
- **Attrition Rate** = Exits / Avg Headcount  
- **Attrition by Segment** (Department, Role, Age Band, Education, Gender)  
- **Job Satisfaction Index** (1–4)  
- **Avg Tenure (years)**

## Example insights (illustrative)
- Sales & R&D show higher attrition; ages **25–34** most impacted.
- Satisfaction ≤ 2 correlates with higher exits in certain roles.
- Early tenure (≤ 2 years) churns more → onboarding/mentorship gap.

## Tech stack
- **Visualization:** Tableau Public  
- **Data Prep / SQL:** PostgreSQL , CSV  
- **Version control:** Git & GitHub
